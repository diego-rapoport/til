# Alternative Copy-Paste Shortcut

Most people know `CTRL+C` / `CMD+C` for copying and `CTRL+V` / `CMD+V` for pasting, but there is an alternative too:

- Copy: `CTRL+Insert` or `CMD+Insert`
- Paste: `SHIFT+Insert`

If you want to trap the copy/paste events don't just trap the popular variant, but the one above too.
